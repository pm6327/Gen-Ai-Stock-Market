# 📈 Stock Market Prediction using Generative AI

## Overview
This repository contains code and models for a **Generative AI-based Stock Market Prediction System**. The project leverages **LSTM, GANs, and CNN-based architectures** to analyze stock price trends, optimize portfolio allocation, and predict future stock movements.

## 🔍 Project Objectives
- Predict **future stock prices** using deep learning models.
- Estimate **support and resistance levels** for trading strategies.
- Analyze **market sentiment** using historical trends.
- Optimize **investment portfolios** using AI-driven insights.
